# Lesson 1: Introduction to Python Sets

## Overview
In this lesson, we explore Python setsâ€”a collection data type that is unordered, mutable, and stores unique elements. Unlike lists and tuples, sets do not allow duplicate values and do not maintain any specific order. We'll cover how to create, modify, and perform set operations such as union, intersection, and difference. Sets are particularly useful when you need to ensure all values are unique or perform operations based on set theory.

## File Summaries

1. **notes.py**  
   Contains summarized notes for the lesson, including key concepts on creating sets, working with set methods, performing set operations, and handling the immutability of frozen sets.

2. **lessonOneProject.py**  
   - **Engage and Apply Exercise**:  
     A hands-on exercise where you create a set, add or remove elements, and perform operations like union and intersection to understand how sets behave.
   - **Final Challenge**:  
     A comprehensive final challenge that involves deduplicating email lists using sets, demonstrating the power of set operations to clean data and find common or unique values across multiple sets.
