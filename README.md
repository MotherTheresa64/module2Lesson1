## Exercise 1: Practice Creating Sets

1. Create a list of your favorite hobbies, making sure to repeat a few of them.
2. Convert the list into a set to automatically remove the duplicates.
3. Print both the original list and the set to compare.

Example:
```python
# Original list with duplicates
hobbies = ['reading', 'swimming', 'reading', 'coding', 'swimming']

# Convert list to set to remove duplicates
unique_hobbies = set(hobbies)

# Print original list and set
print("Original list:", hobbies)
print("Set with unique hobbies:", unique_hobbies)
```

## Exercise 2: Loop Through a Set

1. Create a set of your top 5 favorite books or movies.
2. Write a for loop to print each item in the set.

## Exercise 3: Set Modification Practice

1. Create a set of at least 4 of your favorite foods.
2. Add one more food item to the set.
3. Write code to check if a specific food item is in the set, then print the result.

## Exercise 4: Comparing Sets

1. Create two sets of your favorite sports or hobbies.
2. Check if one set is a subset of the other.
3. Check if one set is a superset of the other.

## Exercise 5: Working with Set Operations

1. Create two sets of your favorite vacation destinations.
2. Use union to find all the unique destinations.
3. Use intersection to find common destinations.
4. Use difference to find destinations unique to one of your sets.

## Final Challenge: Email List Deduplication

You have two email lists, but some people may be in both. Write a function to:

1. Remove duplicates.
2. Show which emails exist in both lists.
3. Show emails that are unique to each list.
